        Publishing a full data dump over and over again will delegate change detection -- a fault prone process -- to data consumers. With DCAT-AP Feeds we propose that DCAT-AP catalog maintainers publish an event source API that can help to replicate the catalog towards a harvester, and always keep it in-sync in the way that is intended by the publisher. Therefore, this spec describes how to publish your DCAT-AP entity changes using the Activity Streams vocabulary and LDES. It also provides a specification for harvesters to provide transparency into their harvesting progress.
